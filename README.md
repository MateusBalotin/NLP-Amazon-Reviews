# NLP-Amazon-Reviews

<h1> Objective </h1>
<p>

The goal of this project was to do a sentiment analisys on Amazon Reviews dataset and try to predict the sentiment of the reviews.

<ul>

<li>Positive </li>
<li>Neutral </li>
<li>Negative </li>
</ul>

</p>
<h1> NLTK </h1>
<p>

On the first approach I used NLTK to tokenize the words and to do the preprocessing part of the text and feature engineering (word embedding).

I imported the VADER algorithm, which is a lexicon and rule-based model, that takes into account the polarity of the emotion, positive or negative, and the strenght of the emotion.

Despite that, since it's a bag of words like approach, it doesn't see the words based on their context.

<h1> TF-IDF </h1>

<p>
TF-IDF is another method to transform words into vectors that the computer can read.

It's an evolution of the bag of words method, where it uses frequency that the word appeared on a certain text compared to the frequency it appeared on the whole dataset.
